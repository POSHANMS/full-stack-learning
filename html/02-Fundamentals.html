<!--Div elements-->
<p>The div element has no semantic meaning.</p>
  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>

<!--Section elements over Div-->
<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>
    Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live
    young.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<p>The section element has semantic meaning over the div element which is not semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles</p>
<hr>
<!--Id attribute-->
<p>The id attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element.</p>
<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
<h2 id="subtitle">Movies</h2>
<p>Browsers will see this space as part of the id which will lead to unwanted issues when it comes to styling and scripting. id attribute values should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.</p>
<hr>
<!--Class attribute-->
<p>In contrast to the id attribute, the class attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces.</p>
<div class="box"></div> <!--.box { width: 100px; height: 100px; }-->
<div class="box red-box"></div><!--.red-box { background-color: red; }-->
<div class="box blue-box"></div><!--.blue-box { background-color: blue; }-->
<p>when should you use an id versus a class? Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements. If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use id because those values need to be unique.</p>

<!--HTML Entites-->
<p>An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.</p>
&lt;p&gt;learning is fun&lt;/p&gt;
<p>These types of character references are known as named character references.</p>
<p>Named references start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;). By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.</p>
<p>Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference. This character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.</p>
&#60; <!--For < -->
&#169;
&#174;
<p>hexadecimal numeric reference character reference starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon. </p>

<!--Role of Script Element-->
<p>The script element is used to embed executable code. Most developers will use this to execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web pages. Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.</p>
<body>
  <script>
    //alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
&lt;script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script&gt;>
<br>
<p>The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file. src stands for "source". The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document is because of separation of concerns. </p>
